/**
 * Generic manager for Omni's built-in GeckoView WebExtensions.
 *
 * Each built-in extension lives under `assets/web_extensions/<assetPath>/` and is
 * loaded via `resource://android/assets/...` — GeckoView's mechanism for bundling
 * extensions inside the APK rather than fetching them from addons.mozilla.org.
 *
 * Why a single generic class instead of one class per extension:
 * All built-in extensions share the same lifecycle — ensureBuiltIn → setAllowedInPrivateBrowsing
 * → enable/disable. The only differences are the asset path and extension ID, both of
 * which are injected at construction time. Duplicating this logic per-extension was
 * causing silent divergence (e.g., one manager missing the private-browsing grant).
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```
 * val aiBlocker = BuiltInExtensionManager(
 *     runtime = geckoRuntime,
 *     assetPath = "web_extensions/ai_blocker/",
 *     extensionId = "omni-ai-blocker@omnibrowser.app",
 *     label = "AI Blocker"
 * )
 * aiBlocker.installAndSync(enabled = true)
 * ```
 *
 * Thread-safety: GeckoView's [WebExtensionController] callbacks fire on the main thread.
 * The [onComplete] lambda is always invoked on the calling thread of the GeckoResult callback.
